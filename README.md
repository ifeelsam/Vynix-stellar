# Vynix: RWA Trading Card Marketplace

## Overview

Vynix is a Real World Asset (RWA) project built for the Pharos Network Hackathon on HackQuest. It bridges the gap between physical trading cards and blockchain technology, enabling users to securely tokenize, trade, and prove ownership of real, authenticated cards through a seamless web platform.

## Key Features

- **RWA Tokenization:** Physical trading cards are authenticated, securely vaulted, and represented as NFTs on the Pharos blockchain. Each NFT is a 1:1 on-chain representation of a real, insured asset.
- **Marketplace:** Users can buy, sell, and auction tokenized cards with full provenance and transparent pricing history.
- **Authentication & Vaulting:** Every card undergoes expert authentication and is stored in a secure, insured vault before tokenization.
- **Ownership & Provenance:** Blockchain records provide immutable proof of authenticity, ownership, and transaction history for each asset.
- **User Wallet Integration:** Native support for embedded wallets and direct on-chain transactions using PHAR tokens.

## Why RWA?

- **Trust:** Physical assets are professionally authenticated and securely stored, ensuring buyers receive genuine items.
- **Liquidity:** Tokenization enables instant trading of real-world collectibles without waiting for physical shipping or escrow.
- **Transparency:** On-chain provenance and price history eliminate counterfeiting and price manipulation.
- **Global Access:** Anyone can participate in the collectible card market, regardless of location, with 24/7 liquidity.

## How It Works

1. **Authentication:** Cards are submitted and verified by experts.
2. **Vaulting:** Verified cards are stored in a secure, insured vault.
3. **Tokenization:** Each card is minted as an NFT on the Pharos blockchain.
4. **Marketplace:** Tokenized cards can be listed for sale or auction, with full on-chain tracking.
5. **Redemption:** Owners can redeem the NFT to claim physical delivery of the card at any time.
